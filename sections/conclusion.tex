\section{Conclusion}

The overall development of this extension was very instructive. Getting to
discover some theoretical concepts, having to understand them and then being
able to apply them in the code is a very rewarding experience. The objective of
project is considered accomplished. In figure \ref{fig:before_after}, we can see
a comparison of the state of the application before and after the extension.
