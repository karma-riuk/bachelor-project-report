# From Flying Balls to Colliding Polygons

## Report

This repository contains the `tex` files that I wrote for the report of the
Bachelor Project (thesis) during my third year at Universit√† della Svizzera
Italiana (USI).

The report goes into great detail on the different steps that were taken during
the development of the project. It focuses mostly on the theoretical aspect of
the project, as this report should resemble an "official paper" (like a master
thesis). The implementation is however not discarded completely, but it is
discussed in a broad overview without going to deep in implementation details.
If you are interested in such details, feel free to take a look at the code
at [karma-riuk/flying-balls](https://github.com/karma-riuk/flying-balls).

The full report is available [here](bachelorproject.pdf). It contains 4905 words
(as per the `texcount -1 -merge -sum bachelorproject.tex` command) spanned over
22 pages.
